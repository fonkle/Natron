This directory contains package-specific files included by build-Linux-sdk.sh.
The rationale is that each file is copied just before building the package in the Dockerfile,
thus the docker cache is invalidated from this step.
That way, when a package version or build script, only this package and the downstreamm packages are rebuilt.
